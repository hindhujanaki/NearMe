            A nursing home, also known as a skilled nursing facility (SNF) or long-term care facility, is a residential facility that provides 24-hour nursing care to individuals who require a higher level of medical care and assistance than what can be provided at home or in an assisted living facility.
            Nursing homes are typically for elderly individuals or those with chronic or debilitating conditions who are unable to care for themselves independently.
